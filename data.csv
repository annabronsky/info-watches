Brilliance & Grace: Exclusive Watches, Thoughtfully Priced. Superb customer service. 

Boxes and Papers included.

For more photos, please send us a message. Thank you, the Brilliance & Grace team . . . more information following the watch description. 



Rolex uses Oystersteel for its steel watch cases. Specially developed by the brand, Oystersteel belongs to the 904L steel family, alloys most commonly used in high-technology and in the aerospace and chemical industries, where maximum resistance to corrosion is essential. Oystersteel is extremely resistant, offers an exceptional finish once polished and maintains its beauty even in the harshest environments. The dial is the distinctive face of a Rolex watch, the feature most responsible for its identity and readability. Characterised by hour markers fashioned from 18 ct gold to prevent tarnishing, every Rolex dial is designed and manufactured in-house, largely by hand to ensure perfection.

One of the most iconic timepieces among the Rolex line-up, the GMT-Master has enjoyed over 60 years of history since its inception in 1955. 



The 1675 is one the longest running references in the Rolex catalog (1959-1980). 

The famous red and blue “Pepsi” bicolored bezel appeared on the very first GMT-Master and remains a favorite option today. 



THE LITTLE DETAILS

Watch is serial # 198XXXX from 1969. Rolex Pepsi bezel is in beautiful, faded condition. Dial, and hands showing very nice patina, with a light butterscotch color. It’s likely this watch was polished once or twice in it’s history. This watch comes with the head only, the BRACELET is NOT INCLUDED.",

Brilliance & Grace: Exclusive Watches, Thoughtfully Priced.  Superb customer service.

Boxes and Papers included.

Free shipping within the United States.

Gold is coveted for its lustre and nobility. Steel reinforces strength and reliability. Together, they harmoniously combine the best of their properties. A true Rolex signature, Rolesor has featured on Rolex models since the early 1930s, and was trademarked as a name in 1933. It is one of the prominent pillars of the Oyster collection. The Yacht-Master II is equipped with a new dial, and new hands that are characteristic of Rolex Professional models, enhancing legibility and sharpening its aesthetic appeal. The dial now features a triangular hour marker at 12 o’clock and a rectangular hour marker at 6 o’clock for more intuitive reading of the watch. A luminescent disc on the hour hand clearly distinguishes it from the minute hand. The Yacht-Master II’s countdown can be programmed for a duration of between 1 and 10 minutes. The programming is memorized by the mechanism so that at a reset it returns to the previous setting. Once launched, the countdown can be synchronized on the fly to match the official race countdown. The Oyster bracelet is a perfect alchemy of form and function, aesthetics and technology, designed to be both robust and comfortable. It is equipped with an Oysterlock folding clasp, which prevents accidental opening and the Easylink comfort extension link, also exclusive to Rolex. This ingenious system allows the wearer to increase the bracelet length by approximately 5 mm, providing additional comfort in any circumstance.

A fantastic entry level Rolex for the vintage lover. The Oysterdate first appeared in the Rolex lineup in 1960s and was finally discontinued in the late 80s. The Oysterdate is quite the oddity, as it's a manual wind watch. It was never fitted with an automatic, even towards the end of it's run in the 1980's. Powered by the Cal. 1225 inside, a 17-jewel mechanism with a 21,600bph frequency.



THE LITTLE DETAILS

Watch is in overall excellent condition with moderate wear and patina throughout. Dial is in excellent condition, with some light spotting from age (see pics). Case has some moderate wear consistent with watch this age. Movement running strong with no issues. Bracelet will fit 7 inch wrist. No Box or Papers. Watch is Serial Number 272xxxx (1971).",

To preserve the beauty of its pink gold watches, Rolex created and patented an exclusive 18 ct pink gold alloy cast in its own foundry: Everose gold. Introduced in 2005, 18 ct Everose is used on all Rolex models in pink gold. The dial is the distinctive face of a Rolex watch, the feature most responsible for its identity and readability. Characterised by hour markers fashioned from 18 ct gold to prevent tarnishing, every Rolex dial is designed and manufactured in-house, largely by hand to ensure perfection. The Oyster bracelet is a perfect alchemy of form and function, aesthetics and technology, designed to be both robust and comfortable. It is equipped with an Oysterlock folding clasp, which prevents accidental opening and the Easylink comfort extension link, also exclusive to Rolex. This ingenious system allows the wearer to increase the bracelet length by approximately 5 mm, providing additional comfort in any circumstance. The new calibre 3285, a new-generation movement entirely developed and manufactured by Rolex. With 10 patent applications filed over the course of its development, this movement features a Chronergy escapement and a guaranteed power reserve of approximately 70 hours. Like all Rolex Perpetual movements, the 3285 is a certified Swiss chronometer, a designation reserved for high-precision watches that have successfully passed the Swiss Official Chronometer Testing Institute (COSC) tests. The 3285 is equipped with a Parachrom hairspring, offering greater resistance to shocks and to temperature variations. Its architecture, in common with all Oyster watch movements, makes it singularly reliable.

",Automatic,48,31,40,Steel,30,Steel,Sapphire Glass,Black,Steel,Steel,,,,"WHY THIS WATCH

The 14060 is generally seen as the bridge between then and now, and the last of the classic Submariners. Nearly a decade after it was introduced, Rolex made enough of a change to the ref. 14060 to warrant adding a suffix to its reference number, but not one big enough to merit a new number altogether. Standing for ‘Modified’, the ref. 14060M was released in 1999 with a revised caliber, the Cal. 3130. The no-date version of the base Cal. 3135 which had been powering the Submariner Date series since 1988, the Cal. 3130 brought with it many of the elements missing from the previous iteration.

THE LITTLE DETAILS

Z Serial number indicates this is a 2006/2007 watch. Case and bracelet have normal wear, around 87%. Bezel has scratches, see pictures. Sides of case look good, with minimal wear and sharp lugs.  Comes with Green Rolex Box, and Papers as seen in pictures.",

Our latest offer is a Rolex GMT-Master II with Coke bezel insert, an Error dial, featuring Roman ""II"" that  doesn't have top and bottom horizontal lines AND the 3186 movement! 

As Rolex was getting ready to release the new Ceramic bezel GMT II 116710 with the latest 3186 movement to be introduced in 08, the production of previous 16710 model was winding down. At some point in 07, this new 3186 movement found its way in the older ref. 16710! We don't know exactly how many of these watches were produced, but we DO know that VERY FEW exist! 

 OUR TIMEPIECE HAS BOTH AN ERROR DIAL AND A 3186 MOVEMENT!

This watch is in very good mechanical condition. The bezel insert, dial, case and bracelet are all in great shape.

It comes complete with original box, owner's manual and warranty card.
